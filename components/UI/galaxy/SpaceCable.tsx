/** The "space cable": one long, meandering wire that drops in from the top of
 *  the page and snakes past every planet — never straight, always curving off to
 *  one side and back — all the way down to the final section. It draws itself as
 *  you scroll, with an energy pulse running along it and glowing nodes where it
 *  touches each planet.
 *
 *  Performance notes:
 *  - No SVG <filter> anywhere. A feGaussianBlur on a path this tall forces the
 *    browser to rasterise a page-sized filtered surface on every repaint, which
 *    was one of the worst offenders here. The glow is faked with a couple of
 *    wider, translucent strokes instead — those composite for free.
 *  - The stroke keeps a constant on-screen width via vector-effect, so the SVG
 *    can be stretched over the page with preserveAspectRatio="none".

   *  History of this one line of sparkle: it started as a second full-length
   *  path with an animated stroke-dashoffset, which repainted the whole cable
   *  every frame. Then it became a dot moved with translate3d from a rAF loop —
   *  cheaper to paint, but it wrote to `style` on every frame, and drei's <View>
   *  reads getBoundingClientRect() on every frame right after. Write-then-read
   *  in the same frame is exactly the pattern that makes the browser recompute
   *  layout synchronously: DevTools flagged it as "Forced reflow".
   *
   *  So now the whole trip is handed to the Web Animations API as one keyframe
   *  set. The compositor interpolates the transforms on its own thread: no JS
   *  runs per frame, nothing writes to the DOM per frame, and there is nothing
   *  left for a layout read to be forced by. Geometry is sampled once here and
   *  only re-sampled on resize. */
